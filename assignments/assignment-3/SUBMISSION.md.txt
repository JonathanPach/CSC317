I would say I learned a great deal from this exercise. I believe that it was a rather
enlightening experience to refresh and relearn HTML and CSS skills after years of not practicing it. 
I kind of completely forgot how some things work, so this assignment was helpful. When it comes 
to doing CSS by hand, without the assistance of AI, it was rather difficult for someone who hasn’t touched 
CSS in years, thus trying to figure out how everything worked and hope to make this look semi-decent was challenging. 
I knew that I could quill ideas in reality but just lacked the knowledge and skill to do so. 
Crawling through various tutorials and StackOverflow pages to try to find the code to make the idea I want was frustrating. 
Overall, rather challenging to create exactly what you wanted without spending an exorbitant amount of time researching how to do so. 
With the use of AI, it’s like magic, being able to create nearly exactly what you want within a few seconds, 
compiling all the information taken from the internet and giving you exactly the answer you want. 
While AI may be useful, it doesn’t give ‘exactly’ what I want, 
so this is where a hybrid solution is useful, using AI as a skeleton and using your own knowledge, skills, and creativity to fill the gaps.
I believe using both is probably the most efficient way at going about things for someone with limited knowledge of CSS and HTML. 
You do not even need to use AI for the entire CSS code, but to fill the gaps in knowledge and to provide an answer that research cannot provide in a timely manner. 
Using both is simply the fastest way at going about things while also providing the result exactly as you want.
