The group project was an enlightening experience. The project allowed me
to experience what group dynamics are like and how to work together
towards a common goal. Additionally, the use of git with a branch for
each person was a valuable experience, allowing me to obtain a greater
understanding of git and its procedures. The usage of databases such as
MongoDB gave me a better understanding of alternative ways to run a
website locally. Putting much time and effort into HTML and CSS
refreshed my knowledge on such topics after I learned it several years
ago, learning new things about web development in the process, such as
.ejs files and the like. Overall, the group project was an unforgettable
experience that provided an invaluable source of knowledge when to comes
to web development.
